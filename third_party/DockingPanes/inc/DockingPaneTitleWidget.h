/**
 * @brief Pane title bar: draws the title text + dotted pattern on the right, and handles dragging.
 *
 * On press it calls grabMouse() to keep receiving events for the whole drag (including when the
 * cursor moves over the top-level docking indicators). The drag events are forwarded to the
 * container through three signals.
 *
 * @note Drag mechanism notes:
 *  - After a docked pane drags past the threshold, floatPane() rebuilds the native window and the
 *    grab is lost; call reacquireGrab() after the rebuild to re-grab.
 *  - When a flyout drag turns floating, hiding the flyout releases the grab; use takeGrab() to take it over.
 *  - Mouse release is only handled for the left button, and m_grabbing records the grab state to avoid a duplicate releaseMouse().
