/**
 * @brief Small close/pin button on the title bar (bitmap + palette tinting).
 *
 * Loads the corresponding PNG from the resources by state (active/inactive, close/pin/unpin);
 * inactive bitmaps are re-tinted with the palette's WindowText colour to fit dark themes.
 * A semi-transparent white highlight block is drawn on hover.
 *
 * @note Derives from QPushButton but completely overrides the painting, only reusing its
 * click/hover semantics; maximum width is 16px, so the hit area is small.
