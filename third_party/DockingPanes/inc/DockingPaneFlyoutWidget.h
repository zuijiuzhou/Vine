 * @brief Popup window (flyout) for an auto-hidden (Pinned) pane.
 *
 * Pops out from the corresponding edge when the edge auto-hide button is clicked or
 * hovered; it has a draggable title bar and a 6px wide resize edge. Focus loss
 * (onFocusChanged) or beginDrag/endDrag notifies the manager to close itself.
 *
 * @note Notes:
 *  - Relies on QCursor::pos() to compute the cursor position, which fails under
 *    Wayland (the host forces xcb to avoid this).
 *  - When opened without focus, the autoHideFlyout signal fires after 1s, but it is
 *    currently not connected (auto-hide only relies on focus loss).
 *  - Ownership belongs to DockingPaneManager/container (managed via QPointer); do not delete it yourself.
