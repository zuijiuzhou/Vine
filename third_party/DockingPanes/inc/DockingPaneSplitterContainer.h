 * and the docked pane side by side. With two children it is an intermediate node of the
 * binary-tree docking tree; sub-splitters without a client branch shrink first (updateAllSplitters).
 *
 * @note Split direction maps to dock position: splitVertical = stacked vertically,
 * splitHorizontal = side by side horizontally (the naming is counter-intuitive, mind the distinction).
