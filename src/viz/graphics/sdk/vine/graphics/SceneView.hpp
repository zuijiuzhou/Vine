/**
 * @brief Host-agnostic interactive primary view: camera + content + navigation.
 *
 * SceneView bundles everything that makes up one interactive 3D view into a
 * single host-independent object:
 *
 *   - a Camera (the view / projection of this view),
 *   - a content Scene (the root drawn by this view),
 *   - a CameraManipulator (default: an orbit manipulator bound to the camera
 *     and scene) that receives window input, and
 *   - viewport bookkeeping: it keeps the camera projection aspect in step with
 *     the rendering surface as the host reports resizes.
 *
 * A SceneView is not a RenderEngine. It borrows one (setEngine): the engine
 * remains the pure pass scheduler / backend owner, while the view owns the
 * "primary view state" a camera used to be given by the engine. The engine
 * holds no content scene: the view keeps its content and binds it explicitly
 * to the passes that draw it (its default window pass binds it on
 * ensureWindowPass()). When attached, ensureWindowPass() registers an
 * order-0 window pass that presents this view's camera to the backbuffer -
 * unless the application already registered such a pass (e.g. a
 * deferred-lighting main pass that carries this view's camera). Several
 * views may share one engine by each binding its own content to its own
 * passes.
 *
 * The engine stays camera- and content-agnostic: it forwards no mouse /
 * scroll / key input, holds no camera and no content scene. The host pushes
 * window input and surface resizes to the view (pushEvent /
 * onSurfaceResized), which forwards them to the manipulator and keeps the
 * camera projection correct.
