/**
 * @brief Orbit-style camera manipulator with pivot picking and projection
 * agnostic controls.
 *
 * Implements a pivot-anchored orbit / pan / zoom camera with a pickable anchor
 * point:
 *
 * - Left-drag rotates the whole camera rig rigidly about the press anchor (the
 *   grabbed model point, or the scene centre on empty space), so that point
 *   stays pinned under the cursor while the model turns about it. The camera
 *   up is carried rigidly by the rotation, which gives the view the roll
 *   freedom it needs to sweep over the top to a true top-down / bottom-up view
 *   and beyond, without gimbal shake or a sudden 180 deg flip.
 * - Middle/right-drag pans.
 * - The wheel dollies along the view: it dives along the ray to the anchor
 *   (the point under the cursor stays pinned to it) and, once the camera
 *   reaches the surface, keeps moving forward so it can travel through the
 *   scene instead of stopping at a fixed point.
 *
 * On every button press / scroll the manipulator ray-picks the scene under the
 * cursor. When a model is hit, the hit point becomes the anchor (the rotate
 * pivot and the pan / zoom depth reference); when nothing is hit the anchor
 * falls back to the scene bounding-box centre, or to the world origin when
 * there is no scene. In FirstPerson mode WASD / arrow keys drive movement
 * instead.
 *
 * A rotate press never applies the pivot (no jump). Away from a drag, pan /
 * zoom and the keyboard orbit are expressed as a level spherical orbit
 * (yaw / pitch / roll about the camera target) so programmatic motion stays
 * stable and level.
 *
 * Both projection types are supported through a single distance parameter: the
 * camera keeps an eye-to-centre distance, which drives the perspective dolly
 * step and the orthographic frustum height.
