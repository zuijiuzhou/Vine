/**
 * @brief A small world-orientation indicator drawn as a HUD render pass.
 *
 * AxisGizmo is a self-contained HUD pass: it owns a content scene with three
 * coloured sticks along +X (red), +Y (green) and +Z (blue), rendered into a
 * square sub-viewport in the bottom-left corner of the surface, and mirrors a
 * source camera's orientation (MirrorMode::Orientation) on every execute()
 * while keeping its own framing distance. Register it like any other pass,
 * with an order above the main view's (RenderEngine::addPass); the engine
 * draws it on top of lower-order passes and notifies it of surface resizes
 * (RenderPass::onSurfaceResized) so it can re-anchor its sub-viewport.
 *
 * Example:
 * \code
 * auto gizmo = intrusive_ptr<AxisGizmo>(new AxisGizmo());
 * gizmo->setSourceCamera(engine->masterCamera());
 * engine->addPass(gizmo, 10);   // draws on top of the order-0 window pass
 * \endcode
