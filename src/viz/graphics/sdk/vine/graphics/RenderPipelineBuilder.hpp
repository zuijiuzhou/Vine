/**
 * @brief Thin, ergonomic recipe layer for assembling a render pipeline.
 *
 * RenderPipelineBuilder produces the exact same objects you would build by
 * hand through the RenderEngine / RenderPass public API, but packages the
 * recurring "recipes" (a main-window forward / deferred pipeline via build(),
 * an off-screen render-to-texture + screen compositing via
 * addOffscreenToScreen(), ...) so applications do not repeat the wiring.
 *
 * It is intentionally thin: it does NOT own the per-frame scheduling,
 * content resolution, lighting or shadow logic — those stay in RenderEngine
 * and in the shaders the recipes bind (the builder only fills in order /
 * content / output / input names and the pass topology). Every add*() /
 * build() call applies immediately to the target engine, and created passes
 * are kept alive both by the builder (or its returned Pipeline) and by the
 * engine.
 *
 * RenderEngine itself auto-registers nothing (its pipeline is fully
 * explicit); this builder is the convenient, reusable way to assemble common
 * configurations, and the SceneView default viewer is assembled through the
 * same Forward preset so the whole codebase shares one main-pipeline recipe.
