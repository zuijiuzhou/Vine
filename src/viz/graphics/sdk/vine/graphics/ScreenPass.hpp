 * @brief A full-screen (screen-space) pass that samples a published texture.
 *
 * A ScreenPass renders no scene geometry: instead it draws a full-screen
 * textured triangle that samples the colour attachment of a source RenderTarget
 * into this pass's output target (or the backbuffer when no target is set).
 * The source is normally resolved by the engine from the named-output registry
 * (see RenderPass::addInputName / resolveInputTextures), so the pass only
 * declares which published texture it consumes. When no input is resolved the
 * pass draws nothing.
 *
 * Typical use: composite an off-screen render target (rendered by an earlier
 * order < 0 pass) back into the window, either full-screen or into a
 * sub-viewport picture-in-picture rectangle (see setViewport()).
