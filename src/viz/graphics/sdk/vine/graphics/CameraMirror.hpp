/** @brief Applies a mirror mode onto a target camera from a source camera.
 *
 * Mirroring is the independent camera-follow component behind HUD content
 * such as an axis gizmo: a small view keeps facing the same way as the
 * interactive main camera while it rotates. It operates on plain cameras only
 * and knows nothing about passes or the render engine, so it can run anywhere
 * a frame is driven (e.g. inside a pass' execute()).
 *
 * Orientation keeps the target camera's own framing distance and rebuilds an
 * un-rolled up basis perpendicular to the source view direction; the target
 * content is expected to be centred on its local origin. FullView adopts the
 * source eye / target / up completely.
 *
 * @param dst  Target camera whose view matrix is rewritten.
 * @param src  Source camera to follow.
 * @param mode Mirror mode (None leaves @p dst untouched).
