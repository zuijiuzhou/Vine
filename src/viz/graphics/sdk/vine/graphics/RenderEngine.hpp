/**
 * @brief High-level render engine managing the frame loop and render state.
 *
 * RenderEngine does not impose a fixed pipeline: nothing is rendered unless
 * the caller registers render passes with addPass(). Each frame, frame() runs
 * the registered passes in ascending order, then ends and swaps buffers. A
 * top / HUD pass (an axis gizmo, a minimap, a crosshair) is just a pass
 * registered with a higher order than the main view; there is no separate
 * overlay concept. The engine is a pure scheduler: it carries no content
 * scene and no camera state - every registered pass draws the content bound
 * to it explicitly (addPass(pass, content, order)), or nothing when it has
 * none. It owns no camera and forwards no mouse / scroll / key input. The
 * primary interactive view (its camera, content scene and navigation) lives
 * in a SceneView that borrows this engine; the pass presenting that view's
 * camera
 * to the window is simply a registered pass carrying the view's camera with
 * a null render target (see hasWindowPass). The engine is
 * platform-independent and delegates actual drawing to a RenderBackend
 * supplied by the caller via setBackend().
 *
 * The engine may be given a host native window (setWindowHandle) so the
 * backend can attach its render surface to it; the host reports surface
 * resizes via resize() and drives camera input through its SceneView. The
 * engine stays platform-independent and owns none of the window objects.
