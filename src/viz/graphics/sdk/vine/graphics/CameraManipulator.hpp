/**
 * @brief Abstract camera manipulator handling user interaction to update a camera.
 *
 * CameraManipulator defines the interface shared by all camera manipulators:
 * interaction mode, window input callbacks, and apply(). Concrete subclasses
 * (e.g. OrbitCameraManipulator) implement a specific camera control scheme and
 * are driven either directly through their motion methods or through the
 * window input callbacks (onMousePress/onMouseMove/onScroll/onKeyDown...).
 * A SceneView typically forwards vine::window events to these callbacks.
 *
 * CameraManipulator is reference counted (RefCounted<CameraManipulator>): the
 * SceneView that drives it keeps an intrusive_ptr so the manipulator stays
 * alive as long as it is attached. The camera must outlive the manipulator.
