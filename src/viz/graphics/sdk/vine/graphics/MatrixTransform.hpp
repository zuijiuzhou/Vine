 * multiply along the root-to-leaf path (Node::worldMatrix()) to place
 * geometry in world space, and render command collection bakes that chain
 * into each command's world model matrix. As a Group it also aggregates
 * children (typically leaf Geometries or nested transforms), and its
 * world-space bounding box is inherited from Group (children already answer
 * in world space, including this matrix).
