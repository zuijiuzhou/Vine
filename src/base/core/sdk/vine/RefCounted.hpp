/**
 * @brief CRTP mixin providing intrusive strong reference counting.
 *
 * Derive from RefCounted<Derived> to give Derived an in-object atomic
 * reference counter. The counter is managed through the ADL free functions
 * intrusive_ptr_add_ref / intrusive_ptr_release, so any type (no common base
 * class required) can be owned by intrusive_ptr<Derived>. Because the counter
 * lives inside the object, constructing an intrusive_ptr never allocates and
 * never throws.
 *
 * Objects are destroyed by intrusive_ptr_release when the last reference is
 * released; the destructor is protected so a raw delete of the subobject is
 * prevented. Copy and move are deleted: a reference-counted object has
 * identity and must not be copied.
 *
 * @tparam Derived The type deriving from this mixin. It must be complete when
 *         intrusive_ptr_release is instantiated (i.e. when the last
 *         intrusive_ptr is destroyed).
