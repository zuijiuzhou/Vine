/**
 * @brief Loads and caches dynamic libraries, one per file path.
 *
 * The loader performs the actual loading and hands out DynamicLibrary objects
 * that wrap the loaded handle. Loading the same path twice returns the
 * already-loaded DynamicLibrary, so each library is loaded and unloaded
 * exactly once per loader. The loader owns all loaded libraries and unloads
 * them when it is destroyed.
 *
 * A bare library name passed to load() is resolved through the configured
 * search paths: each directory is tried in order, then the name falls back to
 * the system default search.
 *
 * On Windows a loaded library's dependencies are resolved from its own
 * directory and the standard directories; extra dependency directories may be
 * registered with addDependencyPath(). On POSIX dependency resolution follows
 * the system dynamic linker (RPATH / LD_LIBRARY_PATH).
 *
 * Use instance() for the process-wide shared loader so every module that
 * links vi::Runtime manages its libraries through one place. The public
 * constructor remains available for isolated loaders, e.g. in tests.
