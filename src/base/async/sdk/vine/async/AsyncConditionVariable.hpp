/**
 * @brief Async condition variable used with AsyncMutex.
 *
 * wait(mutex) releases the mutex, suspends until notified, then re-acquires
 * the mutex before returning; the caller must hold the mutex and re-check its
 * predicate in a loop, as with std::condition_variable.
 *
 * Notification semantics: unlike std::condition_variable, a notify issued
 * while no waiter is registered is NOT a no-op — it is preserved by a sticky
 * flag and consumed by the next waiter. This deviation is structurally
 * necessary: with a separate AsyncMutex, "release the mutex and register the
 * wait" cannot be atomic, and dropping the notification would deadlock a
 * waiter whose notify arrived between its unlock and its registration. Under
 * the standard predicate-loop usage the extra wakeup is benign (std::condition_variable
 * already permits spurious wakeups).
 *
 * Lifecycle (framework contract, see async_global.hpp): the internal mutex
 * protects the notified flag and the intrusive waiter list. The list stores
 * raw waiter pointers living in coroutine frames, so:
 *   - the CV must outlive every coroutine awaiting it;
 *   - a coroutine must not be destroyed concurrently with the notify that
 *     resumes it (no concurrent destroy during the resume window);
 *   - resuming a waiter can synchronously destroy sibling waiters (a whenAny
 *     winner destroys the still-suspended losers on completion), so notify
 *     never holds a waiter pointer across a resume;
 *   - abandoning a wait is safe: the waiter unregisters itself (queued_).
 * queued_ protects the LIST against concurrent destruction, not the frame.
