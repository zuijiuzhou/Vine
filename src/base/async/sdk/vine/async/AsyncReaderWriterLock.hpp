/**
 * @brief Async reader-writer lock with writer preference.
 *
 * Multiple readers or one writer may hold the lock. Waiting writers are served
 * before new readers (writer preference, preventing writer starvation); when a
 * lock is released, queued writers wake first, otherwise all queued readers
 * wake together. This is writer-preference, not strict FIFO: once a writer is
 * queued, later readers do not acquire until the writer queue empties.
 *
 * Lifetime: the lock must outlive every coroutine waiting on it and every
 * guard obtained from it. Waiters unregister on destruction, so an abandoned
 * wait is safe.
 *
 * Usage: auto guard = co_await lock.readerLock(); (or writerLock()); the guard
 * releases on destruction.
 *
 * Internal invariants (guarded by mutex_):
 *   writer_                 => readers_ == 0
 *   readers_ > 0            => !writer_
 *   writers_head_           => new readers cannot acquire
 *   readers_head_ == nullptr => readers_tail_ == nullptr
 *   writers_head_ == nullptr => writers_tail_ == nullptr
 * Never resume a waiter while holding mutex_: the resumed coroutine may
 * immediately acquire or release this lock. Granted readers are resumed one
 * at a time (never holding a waiter pointer across a resume), so a resumed
 * reader whose completion destroys a sibling waiter is safe: the destroyed
 * sibling unregisters itself from the shared list.
