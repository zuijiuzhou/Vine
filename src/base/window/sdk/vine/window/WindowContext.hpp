/**
 * @brief Read-only window data context shared between a host and the render layer.
 *
 * WindowContext is an abstract interface, NOT a window manager and NOT a data
 * store: it does not create, destroy, own or mutate a native window. A derived
 * class holds a pointer to the real window (vsg::Window, a Qt wrapper, ...)
 * and overrides the accessors below to query that window's live state. The
 * render layer (RenderBackend, RenderEngine, camera manipulator) consumes the
 * context through this interface — reading the native handle for surface
 * creation and subscribing to the signals for interaction.
 *
 * Events are delivered via the Signal members. The host (or the derived
 * window wrapper) injects them through postEvent(), which is the single entry
 * point used both by native event translation and by synthetic event
 * injection (tests).
