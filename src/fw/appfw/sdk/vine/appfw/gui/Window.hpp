/**
 * @brief Top-level window base class: wraps a native QWidget (top-level
 * window/dialog) and provides window-level capabilities.
 *
 * Inherits Control (enabled/visible/tooltip/size and other common control
 * properties) and adds window semantics: title (windowTitle), show/close
 * (show/close), modality (modal), size (resize). exec() applies only to
 * windows whose native widget is a QDialog (modal run). Derived by window
 * classes such as ConfigWindow and MainWindow; derived classes build their
 * content into impl<QWidget>().
