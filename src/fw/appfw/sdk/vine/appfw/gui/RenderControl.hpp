/**
 * @brief Render view control: hosts a native QWindow render surface inside a
 * QWidget container and drives a RenderEngine.
 *
 * The actual render surface is a QWindow (the layer a render backend binds
 * to). It is nested inside a QWidget via QWidget::createWindowContainer so it
 * can be hosted by the QWidget-based Control — this keeps Control unchanged
 * (it holds a QWidget) while the render layer gets the native QWindow it
 * needs.
 *
 * RenderControl owns the surface and the wiring: it creates the RenderEngine
 * and a SceneView (the interactive primary view holding the camera, content
 * scene and orbit manipulator) internally and defaults to the first
 * registered render backend on init() (an explicit backend can be attached
 * via engine()->setBackend() first); Qt events on the surface and its host
 * widget are translated and pushed to the view (view()->pushEvent()) for its
 * camera manipulator.
