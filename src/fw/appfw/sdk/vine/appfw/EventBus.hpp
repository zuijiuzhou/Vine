/**
 * @brief In-process, type-driven publish/subscribe bus with polymorphic events.
 *
 * Complements member signals (Event<TSender, TEventArgs>): a publisher posts an
 * event and every subscriber registered for that type or any base type receives
 * it. Events must derive from Object; the bus dispatches along the runtime
 * class hierarchy (Type::parent()), so subscribing to a base type also
 * receives derived events (greenrobot-style polymorphism).
 *
 * Semantics:
 * - Events are keyed by their Type (TEvent::desc()); publish() walks the
 *   runtime hierarchy of the posted event and delivers most-derived first.
 * - Delivery follows each subscription's ThreadMode: Current runs synchronously
 *   on the publishing thread in subscription order; Main posts to the main
 *   thread; Auto chooses by the publishing thread. The bus is thread-safe for
 *   concurrent publish; subscribe/unsubscribe are also safe.
 * - Dispatch iterates a CopyOnWrite snapshot per channel, so subscribing or
 *   unsubscribing from inside a handler is safe and only affects the next
 *   delivery. Queued (Main) deliveries re-check the subscription before
 *   running, so unsubscribing cancels pending delivery.
 * - A throwing subscriber is caught and logged; remaining subscribers still
 *   run, so one bad handler cannot break a publish.
 * - Handlers are stored type-erased (shared_ptr<const Object>) in an internal
 *   channel (EventBus.cpp); subscribe<TEvent> restores the concrete type, so
 *   subscribers keep a strongly typed handler while the public API stays tiny.
 * - The bus must outlive every Subscription token and every pending Main
 *   delivery. The main-thread marshaller is reached internally via
 *   MainThreadDispatcher::current() (owned by Application); if none is set,
 *   Main/Auto degrade to synchronous delivery.
