 * (Scene/Node/Drawable) and VulkanSceneGraph. Rendering is driven by the
 * per-frame render command list produced by Scene::collectRenderCommands:
 * syncRenderCommands() reconciles a stable vsg::Group against the commands so
 * drawables that move or change color only update their matrix / material in
 * place, and a vsg node (matrix transform -> state group -> vertex draw) is
 * only (re)built when a geometry first appears, disappears, or changes its
 * shape or material binding. This keeps runtime scene edits visible without
 * re-initializing the backend.
